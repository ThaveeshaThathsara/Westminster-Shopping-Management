The Westminster Shopping Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage an online shopping system. It allows the manager to add, delete, print, and save products using a console interface, while providing users with a graphical user interface to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and view the final price.

### Objectives
- Implement object-oriented programming principles.
- Design and implement UML diagrams for system components.
- Develop a console menu for managing products.
- Create a graphical user interface for user interaction.
- Apply discounts and calculate final prices based on user purchases.

### Features
1. **Design and Class Implementation (Phase 1)**
   - UML use case diagram and class diagram.
   - Abstract class `Product` with subclasses `Electronics` and `Clothing`.
   - Class `User` for user account management.
   - Class `ShoppingCart` to manage the user's shopping cart.
   - Class `WestminsterShoppingManager` for console menu implementation.

2. **Console Menu Implementation (Phase 2)**
   - Add, delete, print, and save products to the system.

   - Table to display products with relevant information.
   - Ability to add products to the shopping cart.
   - Shopping cart displays list of products and final price.
   - Discounts applied based on purchase history.

### Implementation Details
- Developed using Java.
- Utilized Swing for GUI development.
